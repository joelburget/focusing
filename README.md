# Focusing

A Haskell implementation of Gasche's unique inhabitation [thesis work](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/gasche/themes.html#unique-inhabitants).

In slightly more detail, we try to decide whether there are 0, 1, or more possible implementations of a given type. If there is one, we synthesize it.
