# Focusing

A Haskell implementation of Gasche's unique inhabitation [thesis work](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/gasche/themes.html#unique-inhabitants).

In slightly more detail, we try to decide whether there are 0, 1, or more possible implementations of a given type. If there is one, we synthesize it.

## Reference

* [Which types have a unique inhabitant](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/gasche/phd_thesis/), Focusing on pure program equivalence -- Gabriel Scherer's thesis
* [djinn](https://github.com/augustss/djinn) - "generate Haskell code from a type". This does a similar trick, but in a different way.
